# 4. Description
Basic script to pull addresses from a NTP server using the monlist command. Can also output Maltego resultset.

# 5. Usage
python ntp\_monlist.py target_server (then wait 7-10 seconds(With default timeout and tries))  
If you don't receive close to 600 addresses then either your connection is too slow or the target server is not busy/popular enough.  
The script can act as a local transform for Maltego by changing the OUTPUT\_FORMAT variable close to the top.  
You will need to set the speed/accuracy (results slider to the far right for all results).

# 6. Requirements
